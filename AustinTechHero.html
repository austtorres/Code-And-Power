Tosin Adeniji is a woman of color from London, England whose roots in music have helped 
her be creative in her approach to innovate the tech space. As a marketer for a record
label in the UK, she strayed from the traditional beliefs that her colleagues held. They
were stuck in the idea of investing in traditional marketing such as selling physical copies
of music. However, Tosin felt that with the progression of technology, streaming would
take over the media industry.
<br>
<br>
Following her passion for technology, Tosin moved to New York City to earn her MBA at Cornell
Tech with the goal of transforming entertainment as a whole. The road wasn't easy, though, as
she was the only black female in her class at Cornell Tech. She pointed out that there is a lack
of representation of women of color in tech and executive roles in the industry.
<br>
<br>
Like she did in college, Tosin continues to make it a point to push for conversations regarding diversity and inclusion in her workplace
at Verizon where she is a product manager. She supports efforts to increase representation of women of color in the tech field and wants to
inspire them to learn, grow, and follow their passions for technology even if it isn't a seemingly welcome field to try and enter.
<br>
<br>
A major reason why I chose to talk about Tosin Adeniji is that being a product manager is a dream job for me after college. Being able to be
closely involved in not only the code, but the design, marketing, and engineering of a product captures all of my interests. Tosis Adeniji gave
me some inspiration to learn skills now that can help make this career a possibility for me in the future. I stand behind her belief that in order
to build a product that people love, you have to understand them inside and out. Her story makes me excited for what's to come!
